      <h2>Oxford needs more great technology companies.</h2>
      <div className="paragraphs">
        <p>We believe there are undiscovered founders throughout Oxford that never consider starting a company as a career choice because they are not surrounded by a peer group as equally as ambitious and talented as they are.</p>
        <p>We want to bring together the hackers, builders, and scientists that need such a peer group and support them with an ambitious and earnest community on their journey to founding a company.</p>
        <p>We are interested in speaking to talented technologists at any stage of their founding journey from freshers who put off that problem set to work on their side project to PhDs who are ready to start right now!</p>
        <p>If this idea resonates with you and you would like to be part of such a community, apply to be part of one of our pilot events here - <em>google docs form</em>.</p>
        <p>Event details - <em>coming soon</em></p>
